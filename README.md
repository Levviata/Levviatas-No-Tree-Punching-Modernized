# Levviatas-No-Tree-Punching-Modernized
A resource pack for the well-known Minecraft mod No Tree Punching by Alcatraz Escapee

Description
As the summary says, it makes NTP's (No Tree Punching) textures look more like they do in Minecraft's newer versions.


Features
All tools (pickaxes, axes, mattes, saws, flint tools, clay tools)
All pots (excluding 3D models)
Some miscellaneous items (flint shard; plant fiber; clay brick)


Notes
Yes, I will port this resource pack to all versions; you do not need to beg (begging makes things worse because I don't handle stress well).
Check the Modrinth page for this pack.
