# Levviatas-No-Tree-Punching-Modernized
A resource pack for the well-known Minecraft mod [No Tree Punching](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) by [Alcatraz Escapee](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/alcatrazescapee/projects)

# Description
As the summary says, it makes NTP's (No Tree Punching) textures look more like they do in Minecraft's newer versions.
Â 
# Features
- All tools (pickaxes, axes, mattocks, saws, flint tools, clay tool, knifes, fire starter)
- All pots (excluding 3D models)
- Some miscellaneous items (flint shard, plant fiber, clay brick)

# Notes
- Yes, I will port this resource pack to all versions; you do not need to beg (begging makes things worse because I don't handle stress well).
