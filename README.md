# [!!!WARNING!!!]
### THIS RESOURCE PACK HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ON NEWER VERSIONS THAN 1.12.2, [USE THIS VERSION OF NO TREE PUNCHING IF NEWER UPLOADS ARE NOT WORKING](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching/files/2983385).

## Levviata's No Tree Punching Modernized
A resource pack for the well-known Minecraft mod [No Tree Punching](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) (or also known as 'NTP') by [Alcatraz Escapee](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/alcatrazescapee/projects)

## Description
As the summary says, it makes NTP's (No Tree Punching) textures look more like they do in Minecraft's newer versions.

## Features
- All tools (pickaxes, axes, mattocks, saws, flint tools, clay tool, knifes, fire starter).
- All pots (excluding 3D models).
- Some miscellaneous items (flint shard, plant fiber, clay brick).

## Notes
- Yes, I will port this resource pack to all versions; you do not need to beg (begging makes things worse because I don't handle stress well).
- Check this mod out in [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/levviatas-no-tree-punching-modernized).
